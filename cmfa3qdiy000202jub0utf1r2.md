When working with **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**, most beginners start with the **AWS Management Console**â€”the web interface. Itâ€™s intuitive and user-friendly. But as you grow into real-world cloud projects, youâ€™ll soon realise that clicking through the console is not scalable.

This is where the **AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)** comes inâ€”a powerful tool that helps you interact with AWS services directly from your terminal. Whether youâ€™re deploying resources, automating tasks, or managing cloud infrastructure, AWS CLI can save you both **time and effort**.

---

## **What is AWS CLI?**

The **AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)** is a unified tool that allows you to **control and automate AWS services** using commands in your terminal or command prompt.

Instead of navigating through the console, you can execute simple commands to:

* Create and manage EC2 instances
    
* Upload files to S3
    
* Configure IAM users and permissions
    
* Manage Lambda functions
    
* Deploy infrastructure at scale
    

---

## **Why Use AWS CLI?**

Here are some strong reasons why developers, DevOps engineers, and cloud professionals prefer AWS CLI:

1. **Automation** â€“ Script repetitive tasks with Bash, Python, or PowerShell.
    
2. **Speed** â€“ Execute commands faster than clicking through the console.
    
3. **Consistency** â€“ Avoid human errors when deploying resources.
    
4. **Integration** â€“ Easily integrate with CI/CD pipelines.
    
5. **Remote Management** â€“ Manage AWS from any machine with credentials.

## **Installing AWS CLI**

The AWS CLI is available for **Windows, macOS, and Linux**.

### On Linux/macOS:

```bash
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install
```

### On Windows:

* Download the MSI installer from the [official AWS CLI page](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).
    
* Run the installer and complete the setup.
    

Once installed, verify it with:

```bash
aws --version
```

---

## **Configuring AWS CLI**

Before you start using CLI, you must configure your credentials.

Run:

```bash
aws configure
```

It will ask for:

* **AWS Access Key ID**
    
* **AWS Secret Access Key**
    
* **Default region name** (e.g., `us-east-1`)
    
* **Default output format** (`json`, `table`, or `text`)
    

This creates a configuration file in `~/.aws/credentials` (Linux/macOS) or `C:\Users\<User>\.aws\credentials` (Windows).

## **Basic AWS CLI Commands**

Letâ€™s look at some useful commands:

### 1\. **Check your S3 Buckets**

```bash
aws s3 ls
```

### 2\. **Create a new S3 Bucket**

```bash
aws s3 mb s3://my-unique-bucket-name
```

### 3\. **Upload a File to S3**

```bash
aws s3 cp myfile.txt s3://my-unique-bucket-name/
```

### 4\. **Launch an EC2 Instance**

```bash
aws ec2 run-instances \
    --image-id ami-12345678 \
    --count 1 \
    --instance-type t2.micro \
    --key-name my-key \
    --security-group-ids sg-12345678 \
    --subnet-id subnet-12345678
```

### 5\. **List Running Instances**

```bash
aws ec2 describe-instances
```

## **Advanced Usage**

1. **Automation with Scripts** â€“ Write shell scripts to automate tasks like backup, deployments, or scaling.
    
2. **Profiles** â€“ Manage multiple AWS accounts using named profiles.
    
    ```bash
    aws configure --profile dev
    aws configure --profile prod
    ```
    
    Then run commands with:
    
    ```bash
    aws s3 ls --profile prod
    ```
    
3. **Integration with CI/CD** â€“ Use CLI commands in Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab pipelines for automated deployments.

## **Best Practices for AWS CLI**

âœ… Use **IAM roles** instead of hardcoding credentials.  
âœ… Always set a **default region** to avoid errors.  
âœ… Use **named profiles** for multiple environments.  
âœ… Automate tasks using **shell scripts or Python (Boto3)**.

## **Conclusion**

The **AWS CLI** is an essential tool for cloud engineers who want to work efficiently with AWS. It not only helps in day-to-day operations but also plays a huge role in automation and scaling cloud infrastructure.

If youâ€™re starting with AWS, try to replace some of your **console tasks with CLI commands**â€”youâ€™ll notice how quickly your workflow improves.
