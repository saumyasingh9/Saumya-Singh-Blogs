When working with Amazon Web Services (AWS), network security is a key concern. AWS provides two powerful mechanisms to manage traffic flow within your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): **Security Groups (SGs)** and **Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)**. While both are used to control inbound and outbound traffic, they differ in scope, functionality, and use cases.

In this article, we’ll explore **Security Groups vs. NACLs**, their differences, and how they work together to secure your AWS environment.

## 🔐 What is a Security Group?

A **Security Group** acts as a **virtual firewall for your EC2 instances**. It operates at the **instance level** and controls inbound and outbound traffic.

* **Stateful**: If you allow incoming traffic, the outgoing response is automatically allowed (no need for explicit outbound rules).
    
* **Default Behavior**: By default, all inbound traffic is denied, and outbound traffic is allowed.
    
* **Attached to Instances**: Security Groups are assigned to EC2 instances and control the traffic for them.
    

Example: If you allow inbound HTTP (port 80) traffic, the response to that traffic is automatically allowed.

## 🌐 What is a Network ACL (NACL)?

A **Network ACL** acts as a **firewall for subnets** within a VPC. It operates at the **subnet level** and provides an additional layer of security.

* **Stateless**: Responses to allowed inbound traffic must be explicitly allowed in the outbound rules.
    
* **Default Behavior**: By default, a NACL allows all inbound and outbound traffic (but you can change it).
    
* **Subnet-Wide Control**: NACLs apply rules to **all resources within a subnet**.
    

Example: If you allow inbound HTTP (port 80) traffic, you must also allow outbound traffic for port 80 to return the response.

## ⚖️ Security Groups vs NACLs: A Quick Comparison

| Feature | Security Group (SG) | Network ACL (NACL) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Scope** | Instance level (EC2) | Subnet level |
| **State** | Stateful | Stateless |
| **Default Inbound** | Deny all | Allow all |
| **Default Outbound** | Allow all | Allow all |
| **Rule Type** | Allow rules only | Allow & Deny rules |
| **Application** | Applied to instances directly | Applied to entire subnet |

## 📊 Diagram: Security Groups vs NACLs in Action

Here’s a simple representation of how they work together:

                │  individual instances       │
                └─────────────▲──────────────┘
                              │
                              ▼
                ┌────────────────────────────┐
                │       EC2 Instance          │
                └────────────────────────────┘
```

## Best Practices

* Always **use Security Groups** for instance-level access control.
    
* Apply **NACLs as an additional layer** of security at the subnet level.
    
* Use **least privilege principles**: allow only required ports and IP ranges.
    
* Regularly **audit and monitor** both SGs and NACLs to avoid misconfigurations.

## 🏁 Conclusion

Security Groups and NACLs are fundamental to AWS network security. While Security Group provide instance-level control with stateful rules, NACLs secure the subnet boundary with stateless rules. Together, they provide **defense-in-depth**, ensuring your AWS environment remains secure and resilient.
