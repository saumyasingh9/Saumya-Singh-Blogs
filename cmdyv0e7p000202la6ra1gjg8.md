**What is Amazon EC2?**

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is one of AWS’s most popular services, allowing you to rent virtual servers in the cloud. These servers, called “instances,” can run applications, host websites, process data, or power backend services — without you having to manage physical hardware.

Think of EC2 as your computer in the cloud — scalable, secure, and available anytime, anywhere.

## **How to Launch an EC2 Instance – Step-by-Step**

**1️⃣ Sign in to AWS Console**  
Go to [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and log in with your account.

**2️⃣ Navigate to EC2 Service**  
From the Services menu, select **EC2**.

**3️⃣ Click on “Launch Instance”**

* Give your instance a name (e.g., `MyFirstEC2`).
    

**4️⃣ Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)**

* Select the operating system you want.
    
* Example: Amazon Linux 2, Ubuntu, or Windows Server.
    

**5️⃣ Select an Instance Type**

* Example: `t2.micro` (Free Tier eligible).
    

**6️⃣ Configure Key Pair**

* Create or choose a **key pair** to securely connect to your instance.
    
* Download the `.pem` file and keep it safe.
    

**7️⃣ Configure Network Settings**

* Choose a VPC and subnet.
    
* Allow inbound traffic (e.g., SSH for Linux or RDP for Windows).
    

**8️⃣ Launch the Instance**

* Click **Launch Instance** and wait for the status to become **Running**.
    

**9️⃣ Connect to Your Instance**

* For Linux: Use SSH → `ssh -i "key.pem" ec2-user@<public-ip>`
    
* For Windows: Use RDP with the admin password.

## **Use Cases of EC2**

💻 **Web Hosting** – Run websites and web applications without physical servers.

🛠 **Application Development & Testing** – Spin up temporary servers for staging and testing environments.

📊 **Big Data Processing** – Process large datasets with powerful EC2 configurations.

🤖 **Machine Learning** – Train AI models using GPU-powered EC2 instances.

📦 **Backup & Disaster Recovery** – Store backups and quickly recover in case of failure.

🎮 **Gaming Servers** – Host multiplayer game servers with high availability.

## **Pro Tips**

* Always stop or terminate unused instances to save costs.
    
* Use **Elastic IPs** for a permanent public IP.
    
* Set up **Security Groups** properly to avoid open access to the internet.

**Enable Auto Scaling** – Configure **Auto Scaling Groups** so your EC2 instances automatically increase during high demand and decrease when idle. This ensures performance while keeping costs in check.
