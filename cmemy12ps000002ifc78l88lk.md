Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) is one of the most widely used storage services in AWS. While EBS volumes are highly reliable and scalable, they are still attached to EC2 instances ‚Äî meaning if something goes wrong with your instance or volume, your data could be at risk.

That‚Äôs where **EBS Snapshots** come in!

EBS Snapshots provide a way to **back up your volumes** and ensure your data can be quickly restored whenever needed. In this article, we‚Äôll explore what EBS Snapshots are, why they‚Äôre important, and go through **hands-on practical steps** to create and restore them.

## üîπ What is an EBS Snapshot?

An **EBS Snapshot** is a point-in-time backup of your Amazon EBS volume. Snapshots are stored in **Amazon S3** internally (managed by AWS), making them **durable, incremental, and cost-efficient**.

Key points about snapshots:

* **Point-in-Time Backup**: Captures the state of your volume at the moment you take it.
    
* **Incremental**: Only stores the changes since the last snapshot, saving storage costs.
    
* **Portable**: Can be copied across AWS Regions and Accounts.
    
* **Restorable**: You can create new EBS volumes from snapshots anytime.

## üîπ Why Use EBS Snapshots?

1. **Disaster Recovery**: Quickly restore data if the primary EBS volume is lost or corrupted.
    
2. **Migration**: Move data between regions or accounts using snapshots.
    
3. **Scaling**: Create multiple volumes from a single snapshot for different EC2 instances.
    
4. **Backup Automation**: Integrate snapshots with AWS Backup or Lifecycle policies.

## üõ† Hands-on: Creating an EBS Snapshot

Let‚Äôs go through the **step-by-step process**.

### Step 1: Log in to AWS Console

* Go to the **EC2 Dashboard** ‚Üí Navigate to **Volumes** under Elastic Block Store.
    
* Select the volume attached to your EC2 instance.
    

---

### Step 2: Create a Snapshot

1. Select your EBS volume.
    
2. Click on **Actions ‚Üí Create Snapshot**.
    
3. Provide details:
    
    * **Description**: (e.g., ‚ÄúBackup of EC2 root volume - Aug 2025‚Äù)
        
    * Optionally, add **Tags** like `Name: Snapshot-Backup`.
        
4. Click **Create Snapshot**.
    

‚úÖ Your snapshot will start creating. You can monitor the progress under **Snapshots** in the left-hand panel.

---

### Step 3: Verify Snapshot

* Navigate to **Snapshots** under Elastic Block Store.
    
* Ensure the **status changes to ‚Äòcompleted‚Äô**.
    
* Congratulations üéâ ‚Äî you have successfully created an EBS Snapshot!

## üõ† Restoring an EBS Volume from Snapshot

Snapshots are most useful when you need to **restore data**.

### Step 1: Go to Snapshots

* Open the **Snapshots** section in the EC2 Dashboard.
    

### Step 2: Create Volume from Snapshot

1. Select your snapshot.
    
2. Click **Actions ‚Üí Create Volume**.
    
3. Provide details:
    
    * **Availability Zone (AZ)** must match the EC2 instance you want to attach.
        
    * Select desired **Volume Type** (e.g., gp3, io2, etc.).
        
4. Click **Create Volume**.
    

---

### Step 3: Attach Volume to EC2 Instance

1. Go to **Volumes** in the EC2 dashboard.
    
2. Select the new volume created from the snapshot.
    
3. Click **Actions ‚Üí Attach Volume**.
    
4. Choose the target EC2 instance and specify a device name (e.g., `/dev/sdf`).
    
5. Attach the volume.
    

---

### Step 4: Mount the Volume (Linux Instance)

1. SSH into your EC2 instance.
    
2. Check available disks:
    
    ```bash
    lsblk
    ```
    
3. Create a mount point directory:
    
    ```bash
    sudo mkdir /mnt/snapshot-data
    ```
    
4. Mount the volume:
    
    ```bash
    sudo mount /dev/xvdf /mnt/snapshot-data
    ```
    
5. Verify data:
    
    ```bash
    ls /mnt/snapshot-data
    ```
    

‚úÖ Your restored data is now accessible!

## üîÑ Automating EBS Snapshots

Manually creating snapshots is fine for testing, but in production you should automate.  
Options include:

* **Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM):** Schedule snapshot creation and deletion.
    
* **AWS Backup:** Centralized backup service across AWS services.
    
* **Lambda Functions + CloudWatch Events:** Build custom automation logic.

## üìä Diagram: EBS Snapshot Workflow

```plaintext
   EC2 Instance --> EBS Volume --> EBS Snapshot (S3 Storage)
                                     |
                                     v
                              Restore to New EBS Volume
                                     |
                                     v
                                Attach to EC2 Instance
```
