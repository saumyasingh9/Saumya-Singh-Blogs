When working in **AWS**, storage isnâ€™t just about saving data â€” itâ€™s about choosing the **right type** of storage for performance, scalability, and cost efficiency.

AWS offers multiple storage services, but three of the most widely used are:

* **Amazon S3** (Simple Storage Service)
    
* **Amazon EFS** (Elastic File System)
    
* **Amazon EBS** (Elastic Block Store)
    

Each has unique strengths and use cases. Letâ€™s break them down.

---

### **1\. Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**

ðŸ“Œ **Type:** Object storage  
ðŸ“Œ **Best For:** Storing large amounts of unstructured data, backups, logs, media files.  
ðŸ“Œ **Access:** Accessible over the internet via HTTP/HTTPS API.

**Key Features:**

* Highly scalable â€” stores unlimited data.
    
* 99.999999999% (11 9â€™s) durability.
    
* Pay only for storage used.
    
* Supports different storage classes (Standard, Infrequent Access, Glacier).
    

**Common Use Cases:**

* Hosting static websites.
    
* Data backup and archival.
    
* Big data analytics storage.
    
* Serving images/videos.

### **2\. Amazon EFS (Elastic File System)**

ðŸ“Œ **Type:** Managed NFS (Network File System)  
ðŸ“Œ **Best For:** Shared file storage between multiple EC2 instances.  
ðŸ“Œ **Access:** Mounted via NFS protocol across multiple Availability Zones.

**Key Features:**

* Fully managed â€” no need to manage file servers.
    
* Scales automatically as files are added/removed.
    
* Can be accessed by multiple EC2 instances simultaneously.
    
* Ideal for Linux workloads.
    

**Common Use Cases:**

* Shared application data.
    
* Content management systems.
    
* Developer environments where multiple servers access the same files.

### **3\. Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)**

ðŸ“Œ **Type:** Block storage (like a virtual hard drive)  
ðŸ“Œ **Best For:** Attaching to a single EC2 instance for databases, OS, or applications.  
ðŸ“Œ **Access:** Mounted to **one EC2 instance at a time** (can be detached and reattached).

**Key Features:**

* Low latency and high performance.
    
* Persistent storage for EC2 even after stop/restart.
    
* Snapshots for backup and recovery.
    
* SSD and HDD options.
    

**Common Use Cases:**

* Storing application data and databases.
    
* Hosting operating system volumes.
    
* High-performance workloads.

## **Comparison Table**

| Feature | S3 (Object) | EFS (File) | EBS (Block) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Storage Type** | Object Storage | File Storage (NFS) | Block Storage |
| **Access** | HTTP/HTTPS API | NFS protocol | Mounted to EC2 |
| **Multi-Instance** | Yes (publicly) | Yes | No |
| **Scalability** | Unlimited | Automatic scaling | Fixed size, manual scale |
| **Durability** | 11 9â€™s | 99.999999999% | 99.999% |
| **Best For** | Backups, archives, media | Shared files across EC2 | Databases, OS, apps |

## **Choosing the Right Storage**

âœ… **Choose S3** if you need **internet-accessible, scalable, and cost-effective object storage**.  
âœ… **Choose EFS** if you need **shared file storage** between multiple EC2 instances.  
âœ… **Choose EBS** if you need **high-performance block storage** for a single EC2 instance.
