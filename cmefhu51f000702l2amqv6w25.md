AWS retired its traditional **12-month Free Tier** for new accounts as of **July 15, 2025**.

* New users now get a **$100 credit upon sign-up**, and can **earn up to $100 more** by completing guided activities—a total of **$200 in credits**. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-free-tier-update-new-customers-can-get-started-and-explore-aws-with-up-to-200-in-credits/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [AWS in Plain English](https://aws.plainenglish.io/aws-revamps-free-tier-what-new-accounts-need-to-know-in-2025-9c9c63548fc3?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [DEV Community](https://dev.to/cloud_man/new-aws-free-tier-updates-after-july-15-2025-what-you-need-to-know-3m36?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
    
* There are **two plan options** at sign-up: the **Free Plan** (6-month credit-limited sandbox) or **Paid Plan** (full access, pay-as-you-go beyond credits). ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-free-tier-update-new-customers-can-get-started-and-explore-aws-with-up-to-200-in-credits/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [AWS in Plain English](https://aws.plainenglish.io/aws-revamps-free-tier-what-new-accounts-need-to-know-in-2025-9c9c63548fc3?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [DEV Community](https://dev.to/aws-builders/whats-new-in-aws-free-tier-2025-2ba5?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
    
* Always-Free services (30+ AWS services with monthly usage limits) remain part of both plans. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-free-tier-update-new-customers-can-get-started-and-explore-aws-with-up-to-200-in-credits/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [DEV Community](https://dev.to/cloud_man/new-aws-free-tier-updates-after-july-15-2025-what-you-need-to-know-3m36?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [AWS in Plain English](https://aws.plainenglish.io/aws-revamps-free-tier-what-new-accounts-need-to-know-in-2025-9c9c63548fc3?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
    
* Choose the **Free Plan** for experimentation and proof-of-concepts; switch to **Paid Plan** when you're ready for production and scaling.

## What Changed (as of July 15, 2025)

### 1\. Replaces the 12-Month Free Tier with a 6-Month Credit-Based Model

The old 12-month tier offering fixed usage limits for EC2, S3, RDS, etc., is now **deprecated** for new accounts. Instead, you'll get **$100 at signup plus up to $100 more via activities**—valid for **6 months or until credits are spent**, **whichever comes first**. ([Medium](https://medium.com/%40kiran_c/big-news-aws-free-tier-just-got-a-major-overhaul-in-july-2025-63e143d82381?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [DEV Community](https://dev.to/cloud_man/new-aws-free-tier-updates-after-july-15-2025-what-you-need-to-know-3m36?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [AWS in Plain English](https://aws.plainenglish.io/aws-revamps-free-tier-what-new-accounts-need-to-know-in-2025-9c9c63548fc3?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

### 2\. Two Plan Options at Signup

* **Free Plan** (6-month sandbox): No charges unless you upgrade; some services—especially those that could exhaust credits quickly—are restricted. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-free-tier-update-new-customers-can-get-started-and-explore-aws-with-up-to-200-in-credits/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [AWS in Plain English](https://aws.plainenglish.io/aws-revamps-free-tier-what-new-accounts-need-to-know-in-2025-9c9c63548fc3?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [DEV Community](https://dev.to/aws-builders/whats-new-in-aws-free-tier-2025-2ba5?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
    
* **Paid Plan**: Full AWS access from day one; credits apply to eligible usage, and you pay for anything beyond them. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-free-tier-update-new-customers-can-get-started-and-explore-aws-with-up-to-200-in-credits/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/free-tier-plans.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [DEV Community](https://dev.to/aws-builders/whats-new-in-aws-free-tier-2025-2ba5?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
    

### 3\. Earn Extra Credits via Guided Activities

Complete activities (e.g. launching an EC2 instance, creating an RDS database, using Lambda, Amazon Bedrock’s playground, and setting up AWS Budgets) to earn **$20 per task**, up to $100 more. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-free-tier-update-new-customers-can-get-started-and-explore-aws-with-up-to-200-in-credits/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

### 4\. Always-Free Services Still Available

Even beyond credits or plan type, you have access to **30+ always-free services**, with usage limits like 1M Lambda requests/month, 5 GB S3 storage, 25 GB DynamoDB storage, etc. ([DEV Community](https://dev.to/cloud_man/new-aws-free-tier-updates-after-july-15-2025-what-you-need-to-know-3m36?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [AWS in Plain English](https://aws.plainenglish.io/aws-revamps-free-tier-what-new-accounts-need-to-know-in-2025-9c9c63548fc3?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

### 5\. Automatic Account Closure & Grace Period

If you’re on the Free Plan and either your credits run out or 6 months pass, your account will be **automatically closed**. AWS retains your data for **90 days** before permanent deletion. Upgrade to Paid Plan during that window to keep everything active and retain unused credits. ([AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/free-tier-plans.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [DEV Community](https://dev.to/aws-builders/whats-new-in-aws-free-tier-2025-2ba5?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

### 6\. Legacy Accounts Unaffected

If your AWS account was created **before July 15, 2025**, you continue under the classic Free Tier model: 12-month trials, always-free services, and no auto-closure. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-free-tier-update-new-customers-can-get-started-and-explore-aws-with-up-to-200-in-credits/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [AWS in Plain English](https://aws.plainenglish.io/aws-revamps-free-tier-what-new-accounts-need-to-know-in-2025-9c9c63548fc3?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [DEV Community](https://dev.to/aws-builders/whats-new-in-aws-free-tier-2025-2ba5?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

### 5\. Use Always-Free Services Even After Credits

Even if your credits run out, services like Lambda, S3, DynamoDB remain free within usage limits.

## Why This Upgrade Matters

| Benefit | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Larger Value** | Potentially **$200 in credits** — more than ever before.

| **Hands-On Learning** | Guided task-based credit earning encourages deep exploration.

| **Cost Safety Net** | Credit disappears before real charges kick in; alerts help you avoid surprises. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-free-tier-update-new-customers-can-get-started-and-explore-aws-with-up-to-200-in-credits/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Medium](https://medium.com/%40shraddharao_/best-practices-for-using-aws-free-tier-without-unexpected-charges-f55da0c337cd?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) |
| **Simplified Lifecycle** | Shorter, structured free period focused on active experimentation; cleanup and transition clear. ([AWS in Plain English](https://aws.plainenglish.io/aws-revamps-free-tier-what-new-accounts-need-to-know-in-2025-9c9c63548fc3?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [DEV Community](https://dev.to/aws-builders/whats-new-in-aws-free-tier-2025-2ba5?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) |
| **Continuity for Long-Term Users** | Legacy users keep the old system; new users get a more dynamic, credit-based model.

## Final Thoughts

The AWS Free Tier revamp effective **July 15, 2025**, offers a double-edged sword: **more value ($200 credits)** but **a shorter timeline (6 months)** and **some limitations on high-cost services**.

* **Who should pick the Free Plan?** Students, beginners, and developers doing experimentation or proof-of-concepts.
    
* **Who should go Paid from day one?** Startup teams or hobbyists wanting access to the full AWS ecosystem with seamless scaling.
    

Whichever you choose, this revamped Free Tier is a powerful opportunity to explore, learn, and prototype on AWS with minimal upfront cost—but be proactive to make the most of it before credits or time run out.
