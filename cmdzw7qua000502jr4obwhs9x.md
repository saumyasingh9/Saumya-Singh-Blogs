In today‚Äôs digital world, being able to launch your own server on the internet is an essential skill for developers, cloud enthusiasts, and IT professionals. Thanks to **AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**, it‚Äôs easier than ever to spin up a server in minutes and make it publicly accessible to anyone across the globe.

In this guide, we‚Äôll go step-by-step on how to:

1. Set up an EC2 instance.
    
2. Install a basic web server.
    
3. Access it using the public IP address.
    

By the end, you‚Äôll have your own mini-server live on the internet‚Äîready to host websites, applications, or testing environments.

### **Step 1: Understanding EC2**

**Amazon EC2** is a cloud-based virtual server that you can configure as per your requirements. Instead of buying physical hardware, you rent virtual computing power from AWS, which you can scale up or down as needed.

Some key benefits of EC2:

* On-demand resources‚Äîpay only for what you use.
    
* Flexibility to choose OS, storage, CPU, and memory.
    
* Accessibility from anywhere via the internet.

### **Step 2: Launching an EC2 Instance**

1. **Sign in to AWS Management Console**  
    Go to [AWS Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and search for **EC2** in the services menu.
    
2. **Click on ‚ÄúLaunch Instance‚Äù**  
    Give your instance a name (e.g., `My-Web-Server`).
    
3. **Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)**  
    Select **Amazon Linux 2** or **Ubuntu** for a lightweight and reliable OS.
    
4. **Choose an Instance Type**  
    For testing or small projects, choose `t2.micro` (free tier eligible).
    
5. **Configure Key Pair**  
    Create a new key pair (or use an existing one). This `.pem` file is your password to access the server.
    
6. **Security Group (Firewall Settings)**
    
    * Add **HTTP (port 80)** to allow web traffic.
        
    * Add **SSH (port 22)** for remote login.
        
7. **Launch the Instance**  
    AWS will take a few seconds to provision your virtual server.

### **Step 3: Connecting to Your EC2 Server**

Once the instance is running, click on it to see details like **Public IPv4 address**.

* Open your terminal (or use PuTTY on Windows) and connect:
    
    ```bash
    ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@your-public-ip
    ```
    
    *(Replace* `your-key.pem` with your actual key file and `your-public-ip` with the IP from the EC2 console.)

### **Step 4: Installing a Web Server**

Let‚Äôs make this server display a basic webpage.

For Amazon Linux:

```bash
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install httpd -y
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd
```

For Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2 -y
sudo systemctl start apache2
sudo systemctl enable apache2
```

### **Step 5: Creating Your Homepage**

Create a basic HTML page:

```bash
echo "<h1>Hello from My EC2 Server!</h1>" | sudo tee /var/www/html/index.html
```

---

### **Step 6: Accessing Your Server on the Internet**

* Go back to the EC2 console and copy the **Public IPv4 address**.
    
* Paste it into your browser:
    
    ```plaintext
    http://<your-public-ip>
    ```
    
* If you‚Äôve configured everything correctly, you‚Äôll see your **"Hello from My EC2 Server!"** message live.

### **Step 7: Keeping Your Server Secure**

While it‚Äôs exciting to have your server live, you should also:

* Keep software updated (`sudo yum update -y` or `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y`).
    
* Use strong SSH keys and disable password logins.
    
* Only open necessary ports in the Security Group.

## **Conclusion**

You‚Äôve just set up your own internet-accessible server using AWS EC2! üéâ  
With this knowledge, you can host websites, test applications, run APIs, or even build full-stack environments. The best part? AWS EC2 is pay-as-you-go, so you can start small and scale as needed.

So, what‚Äôs next? Try installing **Nginx**, deploying a **Node.js app**, or setting up a **WordPress blog**‚Äîall from your very own cloud server.
