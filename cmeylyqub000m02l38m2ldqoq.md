Introduction

For developers and cloud enthusiasts, switching between Windows and Linux often feels like a necessity. While Windows offers a familiar ecosystem for productivity tools, Linux provides the flexibility and power for development, especially in cloud and DevOps workflows. Thanks to **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**, you no longer need a dual boot or a heavy virtual machine—Linux can run directly inside your Windows system.

In this article, we’ll explore what WSL is and walk through the steps to install and launch **Ubuntu WSL on Windows 11**.

### What is WSL?

WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) is a feature in Windows that allows you to run a Linux distribution alongside your Windows environment. Unlike a traditional VM, WSL is lightweight and integrates deeply with Windows. With WSL, you can:

* Run native Linux commands directly in Windows.
    
* Access Linux file systems from Windows Explorer.
    
* Use Linux tools (like Bash, apt, git, Python, Docker, etc.) without leaving Windows.
    
* Enable seamless workflows for DevOps, Cloud, and development projects.
    

Windows 11 comes with **WSL 2**, which offers full Linux kernel support, better performance, and compatibility with more Linux applications.

### Installing WSL on Windows 11

The installation process has been simplified in Windows 11. Here’s how you can set up WSL and Ubuntu:

1. **Open PowerShell as Administrator**
    
    * Press `Win + S`, type *PowerShell*, right-click, and select **Run as administrator**.
        
2. **Install WSL with a Single Command**
    
    ```bash
    wsl --install
    ```
    
    * This command installs the latest WSL version along with Ubuntu (default).
        
    * If prompted, restart your system.
        
3. **Install a Specific Distribution (Optional)**  
    If you want a distribution other than Ubuntu, you can list available ones:
    
    ```bash
    wsl --list --online
    ```
    
    Then install, for example Debian:
    
    ```bash
    wsl --install -d Debian
    ```

### Launching Ubuntu in WSL

Once installed, you can launch Ubuntu in multiple ways:

1. **From Start Menu**
    
    * Search for *Ubuntu* in the Start Menu and click to open.
        
2. **From Windows Terminal**
    
    * Open Windows Terminal and choose *Ubuntu* from the dropdown.
        
3. **Direct Command in PowerShell/CMD**
    
    ```bash
    wsl -d Ubuntu
    ```
    
4. **Default WSL Launch**  
    Simply run:
    
    ```bash
    wsl
    ```
    
    This launches the default installed distribution.

### First-Time Setup

The first time you launch Ubuntu in WSL:

* You’ll be asked to create a **Linux username and password**.
    
* After setup, you’ll be in a familiar Linux shell environment.
    

Now, you can update packages with:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

and start installing your favorite tools.

### Why Developers Love WSL

* **No Dual Boot Hassles**: Switch instantly between Windows and Linux.
    
* **Access Both Worlds**: Use Windows tools (like VS Code, Photoshop) and Linux utilities together.
    
* **Lightweight**: Runs faster than virtual machines.
    
* **Cloud & DevOps Ready**: Perfect for learning AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines.

### Conclusion

WSL on Windows 11 makes Linux accessible to everyone without leaving the comfort of Windows. Whether you’re a beginner exploring Linux, a developer working on cross-platform projects, or a cloud enthusiast preparing for DevOps, WSL is a must-have tool in your workflow.

So, fire up that terminal and enjoy the power of **Ubuntu on Windows 11** with just a single command:

```bash
wsl
```
