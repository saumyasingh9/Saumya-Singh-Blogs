**Introduction**

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1754979602576/01a9cbde-dca0-4b86-b481-ff32658d07ea.png align="center")

When working with AWS, secure access management is crucial. AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) lets you manage **who can do what** in your AWS environment.  
While **IAM Users** are for individuals and **IAM Groups** are for collections of users, **IAM Roles** are for granting **temporary permissions** to trusted entities without sharing credentials.

In this article, we’ll break down **what IAM Roles are**, how they differ from users, and walk through a **step-by-step guide** to creating and using one — with a **diagram** for clarity.

---

## **What is an IAM Role?**

An **IAM Role** is an AWS identity that comes with **specific permissions** but **does not have login credentials** (username/password). Instead, it’s **assumed** by a trusted entity — which could be:

* An **AWS Service** (like EC2, Lambda, S3)
    
* An **IAM User** from your AWS account
    
* An **External AWS Account**
    
* An **Application** outside AWS
    

Once assumed, the role grants temporary **security credentials** (Access Key, Secret Key, Session Token).

---

## **When to Use IAM Roles**

IAM Roles are ideal when:

* You want **EC2 to access S3 without storing keys** in code.
    
* You want a **Lambda function to read/write DynamoDB**.
    
* You want **cross-account access** without sharing passwords.
    
* You want **temporary elevated permissions** for a user.

## **IAM Role vs IAM User**

| Feature | IAM User | IAM Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Credentials** | Permanent | Temporary |
| **Assigned To** | One specific person | AWS services, users, or accounts |
| **Usage** | Long-term access | Temporary tasks or service access |

---

## **Step-by-Step: Creating an IAM Role**

Let’s create a role to **allow an EC2 instance to access an S3 bucket**.

---

### **Step 1: Open IAM Console**

* Go to **AWS Management Console** → **IAM** → **Roles** → **Create Role**.
    

---

### **Step 2: Select Trusted Entity**

* Choose **AWS Service** → **EC2** → **Next**.
    

---

### **Step 3: Attach Permissions**

* Search for **AmazonS3FullAccess** and select it.
    
* Click **Next**.
    

---

### **Step 4: Name the Role**

* Role Name: `EC2-S3-Access-Role`
    
* Review and **Create Role**.
    

---

### **Step 5: Attach Role to EC2**

* Go to **EC2 Console** → Select your instance → **Actions** → **Security** → **Modify IAM Role**.
    
* Choose `EC2-S3-Access-Role`.
    

---

### **Step 6: Test the Role**

* SSH into your EC2 instance.
    
* Run:
    

```bash
aws s3 ls
```

You should see your S3 buckets without any access keys stored in your instance.

## **Diagram: How IAM Roles Work**

```plaintext
[User/Service] → [Assume Role] → [Temporary Credentials] → [AWS Resources]
```

Here’s a visual representation:

\[User/Service\] → \[Assume Role\] → \[Temporary Credentials\] → \[AWS Resources\]

---

## **Best Practices**

* **Grant least privilege**: Only give required permissions.
    
* **Use roles instead of hardcoding credentials**.
    
* **Rotate and monitor role usage** with AWS CloudTrail.
    
* **Use Session Policies** for even tighter control.

## **Conclusion**

IAM Roles are an **essential security tool** in AWS. They allow services and applications to **securely access resources** without embedding permanent credentials.  
By mastering IAM Roles, you ensure your AWS architecture remains **secure, scalable, and manageable**.
